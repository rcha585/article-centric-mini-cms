## Development Environment Setup & Commit Guidelines

It is important each team member has the right development environment setup on their computer.
Please update this with any other processes your group is following.

Extensions to install:

- [VSCode Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [VSCode Svelete](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode)
- _Add other optional extensions here :)_

Commands to run before commits:

- In Backend `npm run format` to double check code is formatted
- In Frontend `npm run format` to double check code is formatted

All commits MUST have a brief descriptive message

## Git

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is always easier to merge files that are either new files, or files that no one else has changed. Create new modules / components to reduce the chance of Git Conflicts! However expect conflicts to occur as part of normal development.

> [!TIP]
> The below assumes you have experience with GIT Pull requests, if not please address this.

All groups MUST use Pull Requests (PR) with at least 1 peer review for merging code into main, this is to improve code quality and to give team members an opportunity to understand your code in case they need to use it.

If team-members don't need to use PR, then they should be working on feature branches and get latest commits in main by merging main into their feature branch (`git merge main`, or `git rebase main`).

> [!TIP]
> Consider a branch naming convention `feature/<some-meaningful-feature-name>`

Correct and **timely** execution of the PR process with evidence of good code review can contribute **significantly** to a better codebase and team member collaboration.
